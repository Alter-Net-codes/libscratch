# scratch3cpp
Another implementation of the Scratch block-code interpreter and virtual machine, in C++. 


## About
scratch3cpp is a C++ library that aims to emulate and replicate the behaviour of Scratch 3's virtual machine: specifically the parts that deal with interpreting your block-code. 

## Installation
If you like C++, you can install it using the CMakeLists.txt in the root directory. Please note the use of the BSD-3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License.

Bindings for other languages, like Python, are *planned* and to come.

## Documentation
There will be a `docs/` folder when the API is *relatively* stable. 

## Contribution
If you want to contribute, read through `CONTRIBUTE.md`.
